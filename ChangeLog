estd ChangeLog
==============

estd-r7
* Add support for ACPI P-States on DragonFly.
* Improve multi-core support on DragpnFly. For each CPU domain with individually
  controllable CPU frequency, the load of the most loaded CPU is used instead of
  the overall avarage load.
  This avoids issues on SMP systems where a single-threaded CPU bound process
  will lead to at most 50% overall load.
* Ove Soerensen has asked me to take over maintainership of estd.
