1. Who?
-------
 estd is written by Ove Soerensen. 2009 I have taken over maintainership.
 You can reach me via email (Johannes.Hofmann@gmx.de). Updates and additional
 information might be available at my website:
 http://www.ecademix.com/JohannesHofmann/estd.html

2. What?
--------
 This daemon dynamically sets the CPU-frequency on SpeedStep-,
 PowerNow-, and ACPI P-States enabled CPUs depending on current cpu-utilization. 
 It supports NetBSD 3.0 or later and DragonFly BSD.

3. How?
-------
 Installation should be really easy. Just untar, make and make install as root.
 Make sure you have support for Enhanced SpeedStep / PowerNow, or ACPI P-States
 enabled in your kernel-config and you are running as root before starting the
 daemon. You can simply run the daemon without further arguments, it will pick
 some sensible defaults for you (but it won't fork by default). For command line
 options and further details please check the man page.
